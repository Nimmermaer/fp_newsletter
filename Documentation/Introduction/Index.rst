What does it do?
----------------

The extension fp_newsletter is designed to provide a newsletter subscription and unsubscription service for the table tt_address which can be used
by the extension direct_mail. Furthermore it is designed to be compatible with the GDPR. A log is written about (every) action in a separate table.
Note: there are more TypoScript-settings than FlexForm-settings.
But the extension can be used without tt_address too. Therefore an admin-email-address can be specified.
The admin will then get an email with the subscription data.
Google reCaptcha v3 or a mathematical captcha can be enabled too.
Available languages: english, german/deutsch and italian/italiano.
