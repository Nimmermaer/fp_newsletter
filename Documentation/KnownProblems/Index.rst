Known Problems
==============

This extension may have problems when you use more than one language.
Maybe the emails are sent twice and the log-entries are only in one language.

The domain is missing in the emails when using TYPO3 9? Then you need to add the domain in the site-configuration!

A
`bug tracker <https://github.com/bihor/fp_newsletter/issues>`_
is available for this project at GitHub.
