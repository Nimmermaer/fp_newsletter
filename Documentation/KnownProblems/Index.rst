Known Problems
==============

The domain is missing in the emails when using TYPO3 9? Then you need to add the domain in the site-configuration!

The mode dmUnsubscribeMode=1 works only if unsubscribeUid is set.

Since version 5.x there is not only one plugin name (pi1). In some cases therefore you need to change the template
and add, modify or delete the pi-parameter at a f:link.external or f:form.

A
`bug tracker <https://github.com/bihor/fp_newsletter/issues>`_
is available for this project at GitHub.
